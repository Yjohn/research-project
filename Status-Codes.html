            HTTP status codes

        <p>
            They are standard response codes given by web site servers on the Internet. The codes help identify the cause of the problem
            when a web page or other resource does not load properly. The term HTTP status code is actually the common term
            for the HTTP status line that includes both the HTTP status code and the HTTP reason phrase. HTTP status codes
            are sometimes called browser error codes or internet error codes.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, the HTTP status line 500: Internal Server Error is made up of the HTTP status code of 500 and the HTTP reason
            phrase of Internal Server Error. Two major groups of HTTP status code errors exist:
        </p>

        <h2>
            4xx Client Error
        </h2>

        <p>
            This group of HTTP status codes include those where the request for a web page or other resource contains bad syntax or cannot
            be filled for some other reason, presumable by fault of the client (the web surfer). Some common client error
            HTTP status codes include 404 (Not Found), 403 (Forbidden), and 400 (Bad Request).
        </p>


        <h2> 5xx Server Error</h2>
        <p>
            This group of HTTP status codes include those where the request for a web page or other resource is understood by the website's
            server but is incapable of filling it for some reason. Some common server error HTTP status codes include the
            ever popular 500 (Internal Server Error), along with 503 (Service Unavailable) and 502 (Bad Gateway). See a complete
            list of errors on my HTTP Status Code Errors page. Other HTTP status codes exist in addition to 4xx and 5xx codes.
            There are also 1xx, 2xx, and 3xx codes that are informational, confirm success, or dictate a redirection, respectively.
            These additional types of HTTP status codes aren't errors so you shouldn't be alerted about them in the browser.
            Important: An HTTP status code is not the same as a Device Manager error code or a system error code. Some system
            error codes share code numbers with HTTP status codes but they are different errors with completely different
            associated error messages and meanings.
