            HTTP stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol". The entire World Wide Web uses this protocol. It was established in the early
            1990's. Almost everything you see in your browser is transmitted to your computer over HTTP. For example, when
            you opened this article page, your browser probably have sent over 40 HTTP requests and received HTTP responses
            for each. HTTP headers are the core part of these HTTP requests and responses, and they carry information about
            the client browser, the requested page, the server and more.

        <p>
            HTTP headers allow the client and the server to pass additional information with the request or the response. A request header
            consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon ':', then by its value (without line breaks). Leading
            white space before the value is ignored.

        <p>
            Headers can be grouped according to their contexts: General header: Headers applying to both requests and responses but with
            no relation to the data eventually transmitted in the body. Request header: Headers containing more information
            about the resource to be fetched or about the client itself. Response header: Headers with additional information
            about the response, like its location or about the server itself (name and version etc.). Entity header: Headers
            containing more information about the body of the entity, like its content length or its MIME-type. Headers can
            also be grouped according to how proxies handle them: End-to-end headers These headers must be transmitted to
            the final recipient of the message; that is, the server for a request or the client for a response. Intermediate
            proxies must retransmit end-to-end headers unmodified and caches must store them. Hop-by-hop headers These headers
            are meaningful only for a single transport-level connection and must not be retransmitted by proxies or cached.
            Such headers are: Connection, Keep-Alive, Proxy-Authenticate, Proxy-Authorization, TE, Trailer, Transfer-Encoding
            and Upgrade. Note that only hop-by-hop headers may be set using the Connection general header.
